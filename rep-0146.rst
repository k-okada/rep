Abstract
========

This REP aims to define the best practices for robot related parameter
name space for making robot-agnostic packages.


Motivation
==========

As the number of ROS-supported robot increases, we will write
robot-agnostic packages, but still they need robot-specific
information as calibration parameters.

A `robot_description` parameter is widely shared naming convention
among ROS community and this REP proposes such conventions for robot specific information on
parameter, so application program can build their program on top of that.


Specifications
==============

Parameters
----------

robot_description
'''''''''''''''''

`robot_description` stores robot kinematics / geometry information using
URDF format.


robot/type
''''''''''

`robot/type` stores robot type, for example 'pr2' in PR2 robot case [1]


robot/name
''''''''''

`robot/name` stores robot name, default pr2 name is 'robot' [1]

robot/info
''''''''''

`robot/info` stores any other characteristics of the robot, including type, serial number, owner name / email address, timezone, language it uses ...

Examples
========


Example behaviors::

    $ rosparam get robot/name
    olive
    $ rosparam get robot/type
    pepper
    $ rosparam get robot/info
    {serial number: 00000000, owner name : Kei Okada, language: Japanese,....}
